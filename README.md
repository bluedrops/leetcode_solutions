# leetcode_solutions

This is a collection of my solutions to as many leetcode problems as I can do in my spare time.

For all of my solutions, I've done my best to include notes on runtime efficiency, space complexity, and leetcode testcase analysis with runtime statistics against all submitted solutions. For most of the medium-to-hard difficulty questions, I've included both my naive approach as well as my optimized approach.

Feel free to take a look!

Please note that these are by no means the best possible solutions; they are simply the solutions that I came up with. 
If you see any bugs, or huge performance optimizations, please feel free to shoot me an email! I'm always excited to learn about how I can improve my code. :thumbsup:
